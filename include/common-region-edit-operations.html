<p>
  This section covers a set of <dfn>region editing operations</dfn>
  that you are likely to use often while working on a session.
  Depending on your work habits (and experience of other
  <abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr>s) you will find
  some of these operations critical while others are used only rarely.
</p>
<p>
  You can carry out all of these operations from the keyboard (see
  <a href="@@default-keyboard-bindings">Default Keyboard Shortcuts</a>
  for a list). Equivalent operations can be performed with the mouse
  in most cases.
</p>
<p>
  You may want to review your understanding of
  <a href="@@edit-point-control">the edit point/range</a> and
  <a href="@@which-regions-are-affected">which regions will be affected by region operations</a>.
