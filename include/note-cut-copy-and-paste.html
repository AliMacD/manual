<p>
  While in <a href="@@add-new-notes">note edit</a> mode, selected notes can be
  cut and paste as in most software, that is:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>cut: <kbd class="mod1">x</kbd></li>
  <li>copy: <kbd class="mod1">c</kbd></li>
  <li>delete: <kbd>Delete</kbd></li>
  <li>paste: <kbd class="mod1">v</kbd>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These operations use the same keyboard shortcuts as most editing software does,
  and as Ardour uses for regions. Obviously, the paste operation only works if a
  cut or copy operation has happened beforehand.
