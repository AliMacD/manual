  <dfn>Sessions</dfn> are stored in a single folder on the computer's
  filesystem. The first time Ardour is run, it will ask for the default location for this folder, with the initial choice being the current user's home folder.
</p>

<p>
  After the first-run dialog, the default location can still be changed at 
  any time via <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Misc &gt; Session
  Management</kbd>. A particular (different) location for a session can also be
  specified when creating it, in the <a href="@@newopen-session-dialog">New
  Session dialog</a>.
