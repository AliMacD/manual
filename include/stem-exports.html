  <dfn>Stem exports</dfn> are covered fully in the 
  <a href="@@mixdown">Export</a> chapter. A stem export creates one file
  per track, starting at the beginning of the session. You can then import
  each track into another DAW and begin working on it. You lose all data
  except the actual audio/MIDI (no plugins, no automation). This is one of
  the most common methods of interchange because it works between all DAWs.
