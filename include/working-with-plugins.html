<p>
  <dfn>Plugins</dfn> are bits of software that get loaded by Ardour in order to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create various audio or MIDI effects</li>
  <li>Generate audio by functioning as "software instruments"</li>
</ul>

<p>
  They are usually written by 3rd parties, though <a href="@@plugins-bundled-with-ardour">a few come as part of a standard Ardour install</a>. The sources for plugins are many and varied; see <a href="@@getting-more-plugins">here</a> for some information on how to get them.
</p>

<p>
  Ardour supports a variety of different plugin standards:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th><abbr title="Linux Audio Developers' Simple Plugin API">LADSPA</abbr></th>
  <td>An early, simple, lightweight plugin <abbr title="Application
  Programming Interface">API</abbr>, audio effects only,
  plugins have no editors/GUI of their own (Ardour provides one, however).</td></tr>
  <tr><th><abbr title="LADSPA Version 2">LV2</abbr></th>
  <td>An extensible, full-featured plugin API, audio and <abbr
  title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</abbr>, plugins can provide their
  own  <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>s but may use the
  one Ardour provides instead.</td></tr>
  <tr><th><abbr title="Audio Unit">AU</abbr></th>
  <td>OS X only, full featured, audio and MIDI, plugins can provide their own GUI</td></tr>

  <tr><th><abbr title="Virtual Studio Technology">VST</abbr></th>
  <td>Plugins using Steinberg's VST plugin standard. Varies by platform:
    <table class="dl">
    <tr><th>on Linux</th><td>(native) Linux VST plugins fully supported (VST2.4)</td></tr>
    <tr><th>on Windows</th><td>(native) Windows VST plugins fully supported (VST2.4)</td></tr>
    <tr><th>on OS X</th><td>(native) macOS VST plugins fully supported (VST2.4) since Ardour 5.5</td></tr>
  </table>
  </td></tr>

  <tr><th>Windows VST Plugins on Linux</th>
  <td>VST plugins for Windows, but being used on Linux. <em>Not
  supported by normal builds of Ardour. <a href="@@using-windows-vst-plugins-on-linux">Read
  more&hellip;</a></em>
  </td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Adding/Removing/Copying Plugins</h2>

<p>
  Within Ardour, plugins are just another type of <dfn>Processor</dfn> and so
  the techniques for adding/removing/copying/moving processors apply to plugins
  as well. These techniques are covered on the
  <a href="@@processor-box">Processor Box</a> page.
