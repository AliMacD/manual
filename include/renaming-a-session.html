<p>
  Using the <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Rename</kbd> menu allows to give the
  session a new name. A dialog will appear asking for the new one.
</p>

<p>
  This operation does <strong>not</strong> make a new session folder&mdash;the
  existing session folder and relevant contents are renamed. If the session was
  not saved before a rename operation, it will be saved automatically and then
  renaming will continue.
</p>

<p class="warning">
  Ardour's <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Save As</kbd> operation will not make
  a new copy of the session folder and its contents. All it does is create a
  new session file.
