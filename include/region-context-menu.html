<p>
  In the editor window, right clicking (context clicking) on a region
  displays a menu with <dfn>track and region operations</dfn>. The menu begins with the
  name of the region, or <kbd class="menu">Selected Regions</kbd> if multiple
  regions are selected. Selecting it will display <a href="@@the-region-menu">
  the Region menu</a> for operations on this(these) region(s).
</p>
<p class="note">
  Some items may not be in the exact same order as in the main menu.
</p>
<p>
  If there is more than one region layered at the point clicked, the
  menu will also contain a <kbd class="menu">Choose Top</kbd> item. This
  dialog allows to select which region should be on the top <dfn>layer</dfn>. See
  <a href="@@layering-display">Adjusting Region Layering</a> for more details.
</p>
<p>
  Below these items is the rest of the <a href="@@track-context-menu">Track Context Menu</a>, which
  provides access to <dfn>track-level operations</dfn>.
