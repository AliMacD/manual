<p>
  All the details about a selected note can be viewed by context-clicking on
  it. The dialog that pops up will also allow to modify all the properties
  of the selected note(s). Individual properties can also be modified more efficiently
  using the techniques described below.
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>Moving notes</th>
  <td>
    Right arrow and Left arrow move the selected note(s) early and later in time.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Changing pitch values</th>
  <td>
    <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> increases the pitch of the selected notes.<br>
    <kbd>&darr;</kbd> reduces the pitch of the selected notes.<br>
    If any of the selected notes are already at the maximum or minimum value,
    no changes will be made to any of the notes, to preserve relative pitches.
    This can be overrode with <kbd class="mod2"> </kbd>. The default shift
    distance is one semitone. <kbd class="mod3"> </kbd> alters this to
    one octave.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Changing velocity values</th>
  <td>
    <kbd class="mod1">&uarr;</kbd> increases the velocity of the selected notes.
    <br/>
    <kbd class="mod1">&darr;</kbd> reduces the velocity of the selected
    notes.<br>
    If any of the selected notes are already at the maximum or minimum value,
    no changes will be made to any of the notes, to preserve relative velocities.
    This can be overrode with <kbd class="mod2"> </kbd>.
    Also, pressing <kbd>v</kbd> pops up a dialog that will allow to set
    the absolute velocity value of each selected note. Finally, the scroll wheel
    <kbd class="mouse">&uArr;</kbd> <kbd class="mouse">&dArr;</kbd> will also
    adjust notes in the same way as the arrow keys (note that like the arrow keys
    it only affects selected notes, not the note the pointer is over).
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Changing channel</th>
  <td>
    Pressing <kbd>c</kbd> brings up a dialog that allows to see and alter the
    MIDI channel of the selected notes. If the selected notes use different
    channels, they will all be forced to the newly selected channel.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Changing start/end/duration</th>
  <td>
    <kbd>,</kbd> (comma) will alter the start time of the note. <br>
    <kbd>.</kbd> (period) will alter the end time of the note. Both keys will by
    default make the note longer (either by moving the start earlier or the end
    later). For the opposite effect, <kbd class="mod1">,</kbd>/<kbd
    class="mod1">.</kbd> can be used. The note will be altered by the current grid setting.
    To change the start/end positions by 1/128th of a beat, the <kbd
    class="mod2"> </kbd> modifier must be added to these shortcuts.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Quantization</th>
  <td>
    <kbd>q</kbd> will quantize the selected notes using the current quantize
    settings. If the quantize settings have not been set for this session yet,
    the quantize dialog will appear. <kbd class="mod2">q</kbd> will display the
    quantize dialog to allow to reset the quantize settings, and then
    quantizes the selected notes. The default quantize settings are: quantize
    note starts to the current grid setting, no swing, no threshold, full
    strength.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Step Entry, Quantize etc.</th>
    <td>Refer to the <a href="@@step-entry">Step Entry</a>, <a
    href="@@quantize-midi">Quantizing MIDI</a>, etc. specific pages.</td></tr>
