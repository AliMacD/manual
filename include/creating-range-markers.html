<p>
  <dfn>Range markers</dfn> are essentially two <a href="@@creating-location-markers">
  location markers</a> that appear in the <a href="@@ruler">Range Markers ruler</a>,
  and are grouped together to mark the beginning and end of a section in the timeline.
</p>

<h2>Creating a Range on the timeline</h2>
<p>
  Creating a new <dfn>range</dfn> can be done by <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>
  clicking on the Range Markers ruler at the top
  of the timeline, then selecting <kbd class="menu">New Range</kbd>. Two markers
  with the same name and opposign arrows will appear along the ruler.
</p>
<p>
  It is also possible to create range markers from a selected range or
  region in the Editor window, or to using the <kbd class="menu">Ranges
  &amp; Marks List</kbd> in the Editor list.
</p>

<h2>Editing a Range</h2>
<p>
  Both markers of a range can be independently moved along the timeline by clicking and dragging
  them to the desired location.
</p>
<p>
  They can also be moved together by <kbd class="mod1n"></kbd> dragging one marker.
</p>
