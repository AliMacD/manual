<table class="dl">
  <tr><th id="record" style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">[&bull;]</th>
  <td><dfn>Record</dfn>&mdash;The button with the pink circle arms the track
  for recording. When armed, the entire button will turn pink, and change to
  bright red as soon as the transport is rolling and the track is recording.</td></tr>
  <tr><th id="playlist">p</th>
  <td><dfn>Playlist</dfn>&mdash;Opens a playlist menu when clicked. The menu
  offers various operations related to the track's <a
  href="/working-with-playlists/">playlist</a>.
