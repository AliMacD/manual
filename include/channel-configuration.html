  Ardour tracks can have any number of inputs and any number of outputs, and the
  number of either can be changed at any time (subject to restrictions caused by
  any plugins in a track). However it is useful to not have to configure this sort
  of thing for the most common cases, and so the
  <a href="@@adding-tracks-busses-and-vcas">Add Tracks</a> dialog allows to
  select "Mono", "Stereo" and few other typical multichannel presets
</p>
<p>
  The name of the preset describes the number of <dfn>input channels</dfn>
  of the track or bus.
</p>
<p>
  If Ardour is configured to automatically connect new tracks and
  busses, the number of outputs will be determined by the number of
  inputs of the <dfn>master <a
  href="@@understanding-basic-concepts-and-terminology#busses">bus</a></dfn>,
  to which the track outputs will be connected.
</p>
<p>
  For example, with a two-channel master bus, a Mono track has one
  input and two outputs; a Stereo track has two inputs and two outputs.

<p class="note">
  If <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Signal Flow
  &gt; Track and Bus Connections</kbd> is set to <kbd
  class="menu">manual</kbd>, then tracks will be left disconnected by default
  and there will be as many outputs as there are inputs. It is up to the user to connect
  them as desired. This is not a particularly useful way to work unless something
  fairly unusual is done with signal routing and processing. It is almost always
  preferable to leave Ardour make connections automatically, even if some changes
  are manually done later.
