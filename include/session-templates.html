<p>
  <dfn>Session templates</dfn> are a way to store the setup of a session
  for future use. They do not store any <em>audio</em> data but can store:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of tracks and busses, along with their names</li>
  <li>The plugins present on each track or bus (if any)</li>
  <li>All I/O connections</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating a Session Template</h2>
<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Save Template</kbd> shows a dialog asking
  for the name of the new template.
</p>

<h2>Using a Session Template</h2>
<p>
  In the New Session dialog, a combo selector allows to choose the desired
  template.
</p>
<p class="note">
  An existing session can also be used as a template, without saving it as one.
  This is available as an option in the New Session dialog. Doing this will not
  alter the existing session at all, but will use its track, bus and plugin
  configuration just like a template.
