<p>
  A <dfn>tag</dfn> is bit of information, or metadata, that is associated
  with a data file. Specifically, tags are texts, keywords or terms that have
  some relevance to a particular soundfile. Ardour can store these tags
  in a searchable <dfn>database</dfn> so that they can quickly be searched for
  to retrieve sounds based on the tags that have been assigned to them.
</p>
<p>
  For example if the term <kbd class="input">120bpm</kbd> has been assigned to a
  sound, search later for this tag will make the file appear in the
  search list. Tags are independent of the filename or anything else about
  the file. Tags, and the file paths that they are associated with, are
  stored in a file called <samp>sfdb</samp> in the Ardour user folder.
</p>

<h2>Creating and adding tags</h2>

<p>
  Adding tags to a given file is done by opening the <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Import</kbd>
  dialog, selecting the file in the browser, and typing new tags into the tag
  area in the soundfile information box on the right.
</p>
<p>
  Tags are stored when the input box loses focus, there is no need to
  explicitly save them.
</p>
<p>
  To have more than one tag for a file, new tags can either be added on new lines
  (meaning the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key is pressed between two tags) or they can be
  separated from the previous ones by a comma (<kbd class="input">,</kbd>), with or without spaces.
</p>

<h2>Searching for files by tag</h2>

<p>
  Searching for specific tags is done in the <kbd class="menu">Search Tags</kbd>
  tab of the same dialog. Files which have been tagged with the relevant terms
  will appear in the results window. Selected files can be auditioned and marked
  with additional tags if required.
