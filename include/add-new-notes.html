<h2>Adding new notes</h2>
<p>
	For light MIDI editing, the Internal Edit Mode can be used. This mode allows
	to select notes, copy, move or delete them and alter their properties. Adding
	new notes in this mode is done by <kbd class="mouse
	mod1">Left</kbd> dragging.

  For more extensive MIDI editing, the <kbd class="menu">Draw Mode</kbd>.
  allows to <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd> click or drag to add a new note, without
  having to hold down <kbd class="mod1n"></kbd>. However, Draw Mode doesn't offer
  region-level editing nor rubberband selection.
</p>

<p>
	In both modes, a mouse <em>click</em> creates a note at the pointer location
	(or the nearest grid point if grid is enabled), and its duration is one <a
	href="@@grid-controls">Grid unit</a>, even if the grid is disabled. A mouse
	<em>drag</em> creates the note like a click does, but allows to set the
	duration of the note until the mouse button is released.
</p>

<p>So, to summarize:</p>
<table class="dl">
    <tr><th>Selecting, moving, copying, trimming, deleting <em>regions</em></th>
        <td><kbd class="menu">Note Level Editing</kbd> disabled, using Grab,
        Range or other mouse modes</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Selecting, moving, copying trimming, deleting <em>notes</em></th>
        <td><kbd class="menu">Note Level Editing</kbd> enabled, and using Internal
        Edit mode</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Adding new notes</th>
        <td>enabling "Note Level Editing" and then either
          <ul>
						<li>using Draw mode and <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>
						clicking/dragging, or</li>
						<li>using Internal Edit mode and <kbd
						class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd> clicking/dragging.</li>
          </ul>
        </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  There is also <a href="@@step-entry">a step entry editor</a> allowing to enter
  notes from a virtual keyboard and lots more besides.
