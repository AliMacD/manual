<p>
  A track, bus or VCA can be added to a session by either:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choosing <kbd class="menu">Track &gt; Add Track, Bus or VCA&hellip;</kbd>.</li>
  <li><kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd>-clicking in an empty part of the track controls area.</li>
  <li>Clicking the <kbd class="menu">Plus (&plus;)</kbd> button underneath the list of tracks in the mixer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Any of these actions will open the Add Track/Bus/VCA dialog.
</p>
<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>Add</th>
  <td>Selects the number of tracks, busses or VCAs to create, and their <a
href="@@track-types">types</a>.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Name</th>
  <td>Defines the name of the new track(s). If multiple tracks are created, or if
a track with the same name already exists, a space and number will be happened
at the end (e.g.: Audio 1, Audio 2&hellip;)</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Configuration</th>
  <td>This menu allows to choose from a number of route templates, which determine
the number of input ports and optionally contain plugins and other mixer strip
configuration. The most common choices here are <em>mono</em> and
<em>stereo</em>.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Record mode</th>
  <td>This option is only available for audio tracks and affects how it behaves
when recording. See <a href="@@track-types#trackmodes">Track Modes</a> for
details.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Instrument</th>
  <td>This option is only available for MIDI tracks and busses and allows the
selection of a default instrument from the list of available plugins.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Group</th>
  <td>Tracks and busses can be assigned groups so that a selected range of
  operations are applied to all members of a group at the same time (selecting
  record enable, or editing, for example). This option assigns the new track/bus
  to an existing group, or create a new group.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Insert</th>
  <td>Defines where in the track list is the track created. The default is
<em>Last</em>, i.e. after all the tracks and busses, and can also be
<em>First</em>, <em>Before Selection</em> (to place it just above the selected
track) or <em>After selection</em>.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Output Ports</th>
  <td>Defines how the number of output responds to adding a plugin with a
different number of outputs than the track itself. in <em>Strict I/O</em> mode,
the track will only use a few of the plugins I/O and will keep its own number of
output fixed, while in <em>Flexible I/O</em> mode, it will automatically adapt
to the I/O of its plugins. See <a href="@@trackbus-signal-flow">Signal flow</a>
to learn more about those options.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  New tracks appear in both the editor and mixer windows. The editor window
  shows the timeline, with any recorded data, and the mixer shows just the
  processing elements of the track (its plugins, fader and so on).
</p>

<h2>Removing Tracks and Busses</h2>
<p>
  <dfn>Removing</dfn> tracks and busses, is done by selecting them, <kbd
  class="mouse">right</kbd>-clicking and choosing <kbd class="menu">Remove</kbd>
  from the menu. A warning dialog will pop up, as track removal cannot be undone;
  this option should be used with care!
</p>
