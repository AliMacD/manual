	Ardour has automation modes for many of its controls. As of version
	5.9, OSC can control what automation mode a fader uses.
	(<a href="@@automation">See Automation.</a>)
</p>
<p>
	The form of the automation mode command is:
</p>
<p>
	<code>/strip/[control]/automation ii ssid mode</code>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>/strip may also be /select in which case the only parameter is the mode.</li>
	<li>[control] as of Ardour version 5.9 control can be:
		<ul>
			<li>gain</li>
			<li>fader</li>
		</ul>
		This list will expand.
	</li>
	<li>ssid can be a parameter as shown or inline (automation/[ssid]). /select has no ssid.</li>
	<li>mode can be one of:
		<ul>
			<li><code>0</code> Manual mode</li>
			<li><code>1</code> Play mode</li>
			<li><code>2</code> Write mode</li>
			<li><code>3</code> Touch mode</li>
		</ul>
		The mode value may be sent as a float allowing a "pot" or "slider" with a range of
		0 to 3 to be used to control mode.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The next version of Ardour will add <code>/strip/[control]/automation_name is ssid mode_name</code>
	as feedback. A surface may choose to use only the first character of the string (M, P, W or T) instead of
	the whole string (this is in git now).
</p>
<p>
	The touch mode needs more input so there is a Touch command as well (added post 5.9). It is almost identical
	to the automation command:
</p>
<p>
	<code>/strip/[control]/touch ii ssid touch</code>
</p>
<p>
	The only difference is the last parameter is 1 for touched and 0 for touch released. All of the rest
	of the explanation above applies.
