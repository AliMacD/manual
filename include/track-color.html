<p>
  New tracks in Ardour are assigned a random color from a pastel color
  palette, so they should never end up being particularly bright or
  particularly dark.
</p>

<h2>Changing the color of specific tracks</h2>

<p>
  Changing the color of a track is done by selecting the track(s) and
  <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd> clicking on the track header of one of them then
  from the context menu, selecting <kbd class="menu">Color</kbd> and picking a hue
  in the color dialog. Every selected track will be re-colored.
</p>

<p class="note">
  If only one track is changed, <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd> clicking on
  that track's header will be enough to select it, saving the extra mouse click.
</p>

<h2>Changing the color of all tracks in a group</h2>

<p>
  Tracks that belong to a
  <a href="@@the-track-and-bus-group-list">track/bus group</a>
  can share a common color by enabling the <kbd
  class="option">Color</kbd> option for the group. With this enabled,
  any color change will be propagated to all group members.
</p>

<p>
  The group color can also be explicitly changed by context-clicking
  on the group tab in the Mixer, selecting <kbd class="menu">Edit
  Group&hellip;</kbd> and then clicking on the Color selector in the displayed
  dialog.
</p>
