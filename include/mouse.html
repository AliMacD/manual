<p>
  Ardour is designed to work best with a <dfn>three button mouse</dfn>
  equipped with a <dfn>scroll wheel</dfn>. While it can be used with a two
  button mouse or touchpad, at least two key operations will not be (easily)
  available:

<ul>
  <li>time-constrained region copying</li>
  <li><a href="@@generic-midi-learn"><abbr title="Musical
  Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</abbr> bindings</a>
  created by "learning" them from incoming MIDI data</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It is strongly encouraged to invest in a three-button mouse. A good quality
  mouse (especially one with a weighted, latchable scroll wheel) will make the
  use of Ardour vastly more efficient. They are cheap, and time is not.
