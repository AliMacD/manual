<h2>Selecting notes with the mouse</h2>
<p>
	While in Draw mode or Internal Edit mode, any note can be clicked to select
	it. Once a note has been selected, <kbd class="mouse
	mod3">Left</kbd>-clicking on another selects all notes between them. Adding
	or removing a note to/from the selection is done by <kbd class="mouse
	mod1">Left</kbd> clicking it.
</p>
<p>
	In any mode, <kbd class="mod3 mouse">left</kbd> clicking on a note on the
	Scroomer (the piano header of the track, see <a
	href="@@midi-track-controls">MIDI Track Controls</a>) will add all
	occurrences of that note to the selection, while <kbd
	class="mouse">middle</kbd> clicking will only select/deselect all occurences
	of that note, clearing the selection. These Scroomer selections works on all
	MIDI regions of the track at once.
</p>

<p>
  In Internal Edit mode only, <kbd class="mouse">left</kbd> clicking and dragging
  outside of a note <dfn>rubberband selects</dfn> a series of notes.
  <kbd class="mod3n"></kbd> rubberband selecting adds the notes to the selection.
</p>

<h2>Selecting/navigating note-by-note</h2>
<p>
  <kbd>Tab</kbd> selects the next note as defined by their starting time.
  <kbd class="mod1">Tab</kbd> selects the previous note. <kbd class="mod3">Tab</kbd>
  or <kbd class="mod13">Tab</kbd> adds the next/previous note to the selection.
</p>

<h2>Listening to selected notes</h2>
<p>
  If <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; MIDI &gt; Sound MIDI notes
  as they are selected in the editor</kbd> is enabled, Ardour will send a pair of
  NoteOn/NoteOff messages through the track, which will typically allow to
  hear each note as it is selected.
