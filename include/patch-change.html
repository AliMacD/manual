<p>
  A <dfn>patch change</dfn> is Ardour's description for a combination
  of MIDI program change and bank select messages, that (typically)
  instruct a synthesizer or sampler to select a different sound to use
  on a particular channel.
</p>
<p>
  Patch changes are shown within MIDI regions as small rectangles or
  <dfn>flags</dfn>, with a vertical line showing where in the region
  (hence "when") this patch change happens.
</p>

<h2>Inserting Patch Changes</h2>
<p>
  To insert a patch change, the <a href="@@edit-point-control">edit point</a>
  should be located where the patch change should be (within an existing MIDI
  region). When <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd> clicking, and from the MIDI
  region's context menu, selecting <kbd class="menu">MIDI &gt; Insert Patch
  Change</kbd>, a dialog appears allowing to set the bank and program values.
</p>

<h2>Modifying Patch Changes</h2>
<p>
  Context-clicking on a patch change will bring up the same dialog that
  was used to create it, allowing to modify the program and/or bank
  numbers.
</p>
<p>
  The mouse wheel can also be used: <kbd class="mouse">&uArr;</kbd>/<kbd
  class="mouse">&dArr;</kbd> on the patch change will alter the program
  number, <kbd class="mouse mod1">&uArr;</kbd>/<kbd
  class="mouse mod1">&dArr;</kbd> will modify the bank number.
</p>

<h2>Moving Patch Changes</h2>
<p>
  Just <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-dragging the patch change moves it
  around.
</p>

<h2>Removing Patch Changes</h2>
<p>
  Pressing <kbd>Del</kbd> with the mouse pointer into the rectangular area, or
  using the <kbd class="menu">delete</kbd> mouse button operation will remove the
  patch change (the operation can be undone).
