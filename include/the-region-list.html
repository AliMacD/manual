<p>
  The region list shows all the regions in the session. The left-hand column gives the region name,
  and there are a range of times given for information:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>Position</th><td>position of the start of the region on the global timeline</td></tr>
  <tr><th>End</th><td>position of the region on the global timeline</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Length</th><td>duration of the region</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Sync</th><td>position of the sync point, relative to the start of region (can be negative)</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Fade In</th><td>duration of the fade in. Can't be less than 1 ms, to avoid clipping.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Fade Out</th><td>duration of the fade out (positive value, &ge; 1 ms).</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  The secondary clock defines the time unit used in this list.

</p>

<p>
  At the right of the list are four columns of flags that can be altered:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>L</th>
  <td>whether the region position is locked, so that it cannot be moved.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>G</th>
  <td>whether the region's position is &lsquo;glued&rsquo; to bars and beats.
  If so, the region will stay at the same position in bars and beats even if the tempo and/or time signature change.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>M</th>
  <td>whether the region is muted, so that it will not be heard.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>O</th>
  <td>whether the region is opaque; opaque regions &lsquo;block&rsquo; regions below them from being heard, whereas &lsquo;transparent&rsquo; regions have their contents mixed with whatever is underneath. </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  Hovering the mouse pointer over a column heading shows a tool-tip which can be handy to remember what the columns are for.
</p>

<p>
  A handy feature of the region list is that its regions can be dragged and dropped into a suitable track in the session.
