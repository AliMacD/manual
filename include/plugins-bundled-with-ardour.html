<p>
  Ardour does not come with any built-in signal processors of its own (other
  than volume faders) but does ship, since v5.0, with the small group of
  plugins listed below. These plugins are listed as authored by "Ardour Team",
  which are LV2 plugins, and are named with "a-" as the start of the name (like
  a-EQ) or are listed as authored by "Ardour LUA Task Force" in which case they
  are example (but still useful) LUA scripts. These plugins use Ardour's
  generic GUI, and they work on all supported platforms so that projects
  started on one platform will sound the same on another platform&mdash;if they
  use just these plugins.
