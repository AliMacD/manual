  
<p>
  Every track and bus in Ardour is assigned a <dfn>remote control ID</dfn>. 
  When a <a href="@@controlling-ardour-with-osc">control surface</a> or any other
  remote control is used to control Ardour, these IDs are used to identify 
  which track(s) or buss(es) are the intended target of incoming commands.
</p>
<p>
  Remote IDs will be assigned to tracks and buses in the order that
  they appear in the mixer window from left to right, starting from 1.
  Manual assignment of remote IDs is not possible.
  The master bus and monitor section can be accessed by name.
