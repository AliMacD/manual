  An Ardour session is stored in a single folder on the computer's filesystem. This makes <dfn>backup</dfn> very easy&mdash;any tool capable of backing up a folder can be used to backup a session. The location of a session can be chosen when it is created&mdash;by default it will be in the default session location, which can be altered via <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Misc &gt; Session Management</kbd>. 
</p>

<p class="warning">
  There is one complication: a session may reference media files that are stored outside of the session folder, if <kbd class="optoff">Session &gt; Import &gt; Copy to Session</kbd> is not selected during import. Backing up a session without embedded files will <strong>not</strong> create a copy of the session containing those files.
</p>

<p>
  The single folder approach also makes sharing a project easy. Simply copy the session folder (onto a storage device, or across a network) and another Ardour user (on any platform) will be able to use it. The limitation regarding embedded files applies to session sharing as well.
