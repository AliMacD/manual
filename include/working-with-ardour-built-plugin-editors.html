<p>
  To view a plugin editor, double-click on the plugin within the 
  <a href="@@processor-box">processor box</a>. 
  A new window will appear showing the editor/GUI for the plugin.
</p>  

<p class=fixme>Add a pic showing the generic GUI</p>

<p>
  If a plugin does not have its own GUI, Ardour will construct a
  <dfn>generic plugin editor</dfn> from a small set of common control 
  elements. Ardour will do this even for plugins that have their 
  own, if <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; 
  GUI &gt; Use Plugins' own interface instead of Ardour's</kbd> is disabled.
</p>

<p>
  The generic UI can be temporarily switched to by context-clicking on 
  a processor and selecting <kbd class="menu">Edit with generic controls</kbd>.
  This is necessary in order to access the <a href="@@automation">plugin
  automation controls</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In the generic UI, any controller can be reset to its default state by
  <kbd class=mod3n></kbd><kbd class=mouse>Left</kbd>-clicking on it.
</p>
