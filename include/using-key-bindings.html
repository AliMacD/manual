  Ardour has many available commands for playback control that can be bound
  to keys. Many of them have default bindings, some do not, so the list below
  shows both the default bindings and internal command names.

  <tr><th><kbd>Home</kbd></th>
  <td>Move playhead to session start marker</td></tr>

  <td>Move playhead to session end marker</td></tr>
