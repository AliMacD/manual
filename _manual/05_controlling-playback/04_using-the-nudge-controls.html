title: Using the Nudge Controls
---                        


  
  
<p>If there are no selected objects, the nudge controls can be used to move the playhead by a fixed amount backward or forward. The left and right buttons move either backward or forward in time, and the small clock to the left of these buttons sets the amount of time to nudge by. As with all other clocks, you can right-click on the clock to choose the time representation you want to use.</p>
<p>Note that this is a secondary purpose of the nudge controls - it is usually used to move selected objects by specific distances, rather than the playhead.</p>
