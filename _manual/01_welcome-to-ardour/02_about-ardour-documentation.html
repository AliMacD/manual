<h3>Conventions Used In This Manual</h3>
<p>This section covers some of the typographical and language conventions used in this manual.</p>
<h3>Keyboards and Modifiers</h3>
<p>Keyboard bindings are shown like this: <kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd class="mod1">x</kbd>. <kbd>Ctrl-x</kbd> means "press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, keep it pressed and then also press the <kbd>x</kbd> key. You may also see key combinations such as <kbd>Ctrl-Shift-e</kbd>, which mean that you should press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key, then while keeping it pressed also press the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key and then while keeping them both pressed, finally press the <kbd>e</kbd> key.</p>
<p>Note that different platforms have different conventions for which modifier key (Control or Command) to use as the primary or most common modifier. When viewing this manual from a machine identifying itself as running OS X, will see <kbd>Cmd-</kbd> where appropriate. On other machines you will see <kbd>Ctrl-</kbd></p>
<h3>Menu Items</h3>
<p>Menu items are indicated like this: <code>Top &gt; Next &gt; Deeper</code> Each &gt;-separated item indicates an item on a nested (sub) menu.</p>
<h3>Preference/Dialog Options</h3>
<p>Choices in various dialogs, notably the Preferences and Properties dialog, are indicated like this: <code>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Audio &gt; Some Option</code> Each successive &gt;-separated item indicates either a (sub) menu or tabbed dialog navigation. The final item is the one to choose/select/deselect, etc.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<blockquote><p>Important notes about things that might not otherwise be obvious are shown in this format</p></blockquote>
<h3>"Context-click"</h3>
<p>Many times the term <code>context-click</code> is used to indicate that you should (typically) right-click on a particular element of the graphical user interface. Although right-click is the common, default way to do this, there are other ways to accomplish the same thing - this term refers to any of them, and the result is always that a menu specific to the item you clicked on will be displayed.</p>
<h3>Mouse Buttons</h3>
<p>We refer to <a href="/setting-up-your-system/the-mouse">mouse buttons</a> as <kbd>Left</kbd>, <kbd>Middle</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd>. Ardour can use additional buttons, but they have no default behaviour in the program. </p>
<h3>"The Pointer"</h3>
<p>When the manual refers to the "pointer", it means the on-screen representation of the mouse position or the location of a touch action if you are using a touch interface.</p>
