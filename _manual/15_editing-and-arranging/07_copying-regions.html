  <h3>To Copy A Region</h3>
<p>To copy a region, make sure you are in object mouse mode. Move the mouse pointer into the region <kbd class="mod1">Left-click and drag</kbd>. A new region is created and will follow the mouse pointer as it moves. See "moving Regions" for more details on moving the copied region around.</p>
<h4>Copying more than one region</h4>
<p>To copy multiple regions, select them before copying. Then click+drag on one of the selected regions. All the regions will be copied and as they move, the will keep their positions relative to each other.</p>
<h4>Fixed-time copying</h4>
<p>If you want to copy region(s) to other track(s) but keep the copies at the exact position on the timeline as the originals, simply use <kbd class="mod1">Middle-click-drag</kbd> instead.</p>
