title: What Regions Are Affected?
---                        


  
  
<p>This section explains the rules used to decide what regions are affected by editing operations. You don't really have to understand them - hopefully things will Just Work - but it may be useful to understand the rules some of the time.</p>
<p>Ardour divides operations up into those that operate on a single point in time (Split being the obvious example) and those that operate on two points (which can also be considered to be a range of sorts), Separate is a good example of this.</p>
<p> Most operations will operate on the currently selected region(s), but if no regions are selected, the region that the mouse is in will be used instead. Single-point operations will generally pick a set of regions to use based on the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li> If the edit point is `mouse':
<ul>
<li>if the mouse is over a selected region, or no region, use all selected regions.
</li>
<li>if the mouse is over an unselected region, use just that region.
	  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> For all other edit points
<ul><li>use the selected regions <strong>and</strong> those that are both under the edit position <strong>and</strong> on a selected track, or on a track which is in the same active edit-enabled route group<br>
             as a selected region.
	</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The rationale here for the two different rules is that the mouse edit point is special in that its position indicates both a time and a track; the other edit points (Playhead,Marker) indicates only a time.</p>
