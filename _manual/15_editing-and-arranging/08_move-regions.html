title: Move Regions
---                        

<p>
  Ardour has a global <dfn>edit mode</dfn> selector at the left of the
  Editing toolbar, which affect how regions are moved or copied:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><kbd class="menu">Slide</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Regions move freely. Ardour creates overlaps when necessary.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="menu">Lock</kbd></dt>
  <dd>No region motion is permitted (except for "nudge").</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="menu">Splice</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Regions moved freely, but Ardour closes gaps between regions after any movement has occured</dd>
</dl>
<p class="note">
  If <kbd class="menu">Snap To Grid</kbd> is enabled, then regions can 
  only move so that they align with locations determined by the current 
  snap settings (beats, or seconds, or other region boundaries, etc). 
  See <a href="/editing-and-arranging/snap-to-the-grid">Snap To the Grid</a> 
  for details.
