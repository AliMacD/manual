title: Where are Sessions Stored?
---                        


  
  
<p>Sessions are stored in a single folder on your computer's filesystem. </p>
<p>The first time you run Ardour, you will be asked where you would like the default location for sessions to be, with the initial choice being your home folder. </p>
<p>You can change it in that startup dialog, or later via <code>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Misc &gt; Session Management</code>. You can also specify a particular (different) location for a session when creating it, in the New Session dialog.</p>
