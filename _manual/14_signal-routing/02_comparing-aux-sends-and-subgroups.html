title: Comparing Aux Sends and Subgroups
---                        


  
  <p>Auxes and Subgroups do share a common concept - they both provide a way for 1 or more tracks (or busses) to send their signal to a single bus so that common signal processing can be applied to the mix of their signals. </p>
<p>An aux send leaves the existing signal routing to the main mix inplace, and is typically used to create a separate mix to send to (for example) monitors or headphones (for performer monitor mixes). </p>
<p>Subgroups remove the original signal routing to the main mix, but create a new one that delivers the output of the subgroup bus to the main mix instead.</p>
<p>The following two diagrams compares the signal flow when using subgroups and when using aux sends:</p>
