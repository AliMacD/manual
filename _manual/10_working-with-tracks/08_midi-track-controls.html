  <p>A typical control area for a MIDI track is shown below:</p>
<p><img src="/ardour/manual/html/diagrams/typical-midi-track-controls.png" alt="midi track controls"></p>
<p>The MIDI track example is shown at a greater height than the other examples, as with MIDI tracks there are some control elements which only appear when there is sufficient vertical space to fit them in.</p>
<p>A MIDI track has the same basic <a href="/working-with-tracks/audio-track-controls">controls as an audio track</a>, with the addition of two extra elements. The set of buttons below the main track controls controls the MIDI channels that should be visible in the editor. A MIDI track's data may span any number of the 16 available MIDI channels, and sometimes it is useful to view only a subset of those channels; different instruments may, for example, be put on different MIDI channels. Clicking on a channel number toggles its visibility.</p>
<p>To the right of the MIDI track controls is a representation of a piano keyboard called the ‘scroomer’. This performs a couple of functions. Firstly, the scroll-bar controls the range of pitches that are visible on the track. Dragging the scroll-bar body up and down scrolls up and down through the visible pitches, and dragging the scroll-bar ‘handles’ zooms in and out, so that more or fewer pitches are visible. The piano keyboard gives a reference for the pitches that the track is displaying. In addition, clicking on the notes will generate the corresponding MIDI note in the track. </p>
