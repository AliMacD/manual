title: Selection and Punch Clocks

<img src="/images/selectionpunchclocks.png" alt="An image of the the selection and punch clocks in Ardour" />

<p>
  The transport bar contains a set of 5 clocks that show the current
  <dfn>selection range</dfn> and <dfn>punch ranges</dfn>.
</p>
<p>
  Clicking on the punch range clocks will locate to either the beginning or end of the punch range.
  Similarly, clicking on the range clocks will locate to either the beginning
  or end of the current selection. In this screen shot there is no current
  selection range, so the selection clocks show an "off" state.
</p>
<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">In</kbd> and <kbd class="menu">Out</kbd> buttons relate
  to the Punch range, and allow to use only one of the two punch boundaries, or both:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>In only</dt><dd>Records from the In marker on, without a end boundary</dd>
  <dt>Out only</dt><dd>Records untils the Out marker, without a beginning boundary</dd>
  <dt>In only</dt><dd>Records only between the In and Out markers</dd>
</dl>
<p>
  <kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd> clicking on any of the 5 clocks brings up a context menu
  allowing to change the type of time display between the <a href="/introducing-ardour/basic-gui-operations/editing-clocks/">
  4 clock modes</a>, and to copy the selected clock's time to the clipboard.
