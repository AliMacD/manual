title: Region Naming
---                        


  
  
<p>Regions are initially named using either:</p>
<ul>
<li>    the name of the playlist for which they were recorded
</li>
<li>    the name of the track for wich they were recorded
</li>
<li>    the name of the embedded/imported file they represent
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Whole File Region Names</h3>
<p>These are not audio files, but regions that represent the full extent of an audio file. Every time a new recording is done, or a new file is embedded/imported, a new region is created that represents the entire audio file(s) This region will have the name of the track/playlist/original file, followed by a "-" and then a number plus a dot and then a number.</p>
<p>For recorded regions, the number will increase each time a new recording is made. So, for example, if there is a playlist called "Didgeridoo", the first recorded whole file region for that playlist will be called "Digderidoo-1". The next one will be "Digeridoo-2" and so on.</p>
<p>For imported/embedded files, the region name will be based on the file name, but with any final suffix (e.g. ".wav" or ".aiff") removed.</p>
<p>Normally, whole file regions are not inserted into tracks/playlists, but regions derived from them are. The whole-file versions live in the editor region list where they act as an organizing mechanism for regions that are derived from them.</p>
<h3>Normal Region Names</h3>
<p>When a region is inserted into a track/playlist, its initial name will end in a version number, such as ".1" or ".103". For a recorded region, if the whole file region was "Hang drum-1", then the region in the track will appear with the name "Hang drum-1.1". For an imported/embedded region, if the whole file region was "Bach:Invention3", then the region in the track will appear with the name "Bach:Invention3.1".</p>
<h3>Copied Region Names</h3>
<p>If the region is a copy of another region, it will begin life with the same name as the original. When an operation is carried out that modifies one of the copies, that particular copy will be renamed by incrementing the version number.</p>
<h3>Renaming Regions</h3>
<p>You can rename a region at any time. Use the region context menu to popup the rename dialog. The new name does not need to have a version number in it (in fact, it probably should not). The region will retain its name until it is modified after being copied.</p>
