<p>
  Since version 5.0, Ardour has had full support for the Ableton
  Push2. This is an expensive but well engineered control surface
  primarily targetting the workflow found in Ableton's Live software
  and other similar tools such as Bitwig. As of 5.0, Ardour does not
  offer the same kind of workflow, so we have repurposed the Push 2 to
  be used for mixing and editing, rather than the clip/scene oriented
  approach in Live.
</p>

<h2>Connecting the Push 2</h2>
<p>
  Plug the USB cable from the Push 2 into a USB2 or USB3 port on your
  computer. For brighter backlighting, also plug in the power supply
  (this is not necessary for use). 
</p>
<p>
  The Push 2 will be automatically recognized by your operating
  system, and will appear in any of the lists of possible MIDI ports
  in both Ardour and other similar software.
</p>
<p>
  To connect the Push 2 to Ardour, open the Preferences dialog, and
  then click on "Control Surfaces". Click on the "Enable" button
  in the line that says "Ableton Push 2" in order to activate Ardour's
  Push 2 support. <!-- Then double click on the line that says
  "Ableton Push 2". A new dialog will open, containing (among other things)
  two dropdown selectors that will allow you to identify the MIDI
  ports where your Push 2 is connected.-->
</p>
<!--

<p>
  Once you select the input and output port, Ardour will initialize
  the Push 2 and it will be ready to use. You only need do this
  once: once these ports are connected and your session has been
  saved, the connections will be made automatically in this and other
  future sessions.

<h2>Using the Push 2</h2>
<p>
  Below we document the functionality accessible from each control on
  the Push 2. The controls can be divided into several sections.
  <dl>
    <dt>Pads</dt>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt>Buttons</dt>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt>Encoders</dt>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt>Touch Strip</dt>
    <dd></dd>
  </dl>
</p>
<p>
  Conceptually, Ardour dividers the controls into a set of 8 strips,
  each consisting of an encoder (at the top), 2 buttons on either side
  of the display, and 8 pads. All the other controls have independent
  functions.
<p>
  Buttons who function is somewhat related to the label built into the
  device will have the label illuminated.
</p>
<p>
  Buttons that Ardour uses for entirely different purposes than the
  builtin label are left unilluminated, but still provide some
  functionality. 
</p>
<p>
  The upper right encoder is used as a gain control (volume) for the
  Master out or Monitor out busses.
