<p>
  Extenders will require a custom file as there are no combinations listed
  at this time. The best way is to start with the mc.device file and copy it
  to a new name such as xt+mc.device and then edit that file. It is best to
  name the file with the order the devices are expected to be used in as
  the position of the master device is specified in this file.
</p>
<p>
  The two lines of interest are:
<p>
<pre>
 &gt;Extenders value="0"/&gt;
 &gt;MasterPosition value="0"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Add these two lines if they are not present. The <code>Extenders</code>
  value is the number of extenders used and should not include the master in
  that number. That is, it should be the total number of units minus 1. The
  <code>MasterPosition</code> value is the position from left to right where
  the master unit (with the master fader) is, starting at 0. So if there are
  three surfaces, <code>MasterPosition</code> with value 0 would be master
  on the left, <code>MasterPosition</code> with value 1 would be master in
  the middle and <code>MasterPosition</code> with value 2 would be master on
  the right.
</p>
<p>
  If the <code>MasterPosition</code> value does not properly match the
  physcal position and MIDI port, the master fader and global controls will
  not work. The master unit will act like an extender.
