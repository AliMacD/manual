 <h2>MIDI Handling Frameworks</h2>
<h4>CoreMIDI</h4>

<p> CoreMIDI is the standard MIDI framework to comunicate with MIDI
hardware on OSX systems. It provides drivers and libraries needed by
MIDI clients. These ports do not show up in qjackctl</p>

<h4>ALSA MIDI</h4>

<p> ALSA MIDI is the standard MIDI framework to comunicate with MIDI
hardware on Linux systems. It provides drivers and libraries needed by
MIDI clients. These ports show up under the "ALSA" tab in qjackctl</p>

<h4> JACK MIDI</h4>

<p> JACK MIDI is a framework used to comunicate between JACK MIDI
software clients. It provides zero jitter and a fixed latency of 1
"period" (the same latency that exists for audio). These ports show up
under the "MIDI" tab in qjackctl.
</p>
    
<p>
Various ways of "bridging" between the native MIDI framework
(e.g. CoreMIDI or ALSA) and JACK MIDI, as described in the sections
below.
