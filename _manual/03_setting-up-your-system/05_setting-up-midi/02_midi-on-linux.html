  <h2>Ensure that a2jmidid is running</h2>
<p><code>a2jmidid</code> is an application that "bridges" between the system MIDI ports and JACK.</p>
<p>First you should be sure that there is no ALSA sequencer support enabled in jack. To do that open qjackctl's <em>Setup</em> window.</p>
<p>In the <em>Settings</em> tab set the <em>MIDI Driver</em> drop down to the <em>none</em> option.</p>
<p>Then go to the <em>Misc</em> tab and uncheck the <em>Enable ALSA Sequencer support</em> option.</p>
<p>Now it's time to restart your jack server before going on.</p>
<h4>Checking for a2jmidid availability</h4>
<p>First thing is checking if <em>a2jmidid</em> is already installed in your system. To do it first start your jack server and then call</p>
<pre>a2jmidid -e</pre>
<p>from the command. If <em>a2jmidid</em> is there go on with <strong>Checking surface control MIDI ports</strong>. Otherwise install the newest <em>a2jmidid</em> available and try again.</p>
<h4>Checking surface control MIDI ports</h4>
<p>After starting <em>a2jmidid</em> your control surface MIDI ports should appear in qjackctl's <em>Connections</em> window on the <em>MIDI</em> tab under <em>a2j</em>. If it does go on to the next step: <strong>Automatically calling a2jmidid when starting jack</strong>. If it doesn't you have to troubleshoot why it didn't. <em>(How to troubleshoot a2jmidid?)</em></p>
<h4>Automatically calling a2jmidid when starting jack</h4>
<p>It's troublesome to have to manually start <em>a2jmidid</em> by hand each time you start jack. Here is one way to do it automatically. This step isn't mandatory, it's just a convenience. If you are not interested you can go on to the next step <strong>Enabling Ardour's mackie control ports in qjackctl</strong>.</p>
<p>Create a script that calls jack if you aren't using one yet. In it change the line that calls jack to have an ampersand at it's end like that:</p>
<pre>
/usr/bin/qjackctl &amp;
</pre>
<p>In this case I call qjackctl that starts jack so I include the ampersand in qjackctl's call. If you call jack directly, put the ampersand at the end of it's call line.</p>
<p>Now include the following lines after the line that calls jack:</p>
<pre>
/usr/bin/sleep 5
/bin/bash -c "/usr/bin/a2jmidid -e" &amp;
</pre>
<p>All you have to do now is use your new script to call jack.</p>
