title: Balance Control
---                        

<p>
  For stereo tracks, you can now switch between the stereo panner and a
  traditional <strong>balance control</strong> by right-clicking on the
  panner widget.
</p>
<p>
  When the balance is centered, the incoming signals will be unaffected.
  Moving it to one side will linearly attenuate the signal of the opposite
  side.
</p>
<div class="well">
  While it is considerably less flexible than the stereo panner, it work
  with arbitrary content without the danger of comb filter artefacts.
