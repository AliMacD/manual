<div class="well notabene">
  Ardour's VBAP panner is currently in development, and its semantics may
  change in the near future, possibly affecting your mixes. Please do not
  rely on it for important production work while the dust settles.
</div>
<p>
  <strong>VBAP</strong> is short for <em>Vector-base Amplitude Panning</em>, 
  a versatile and
  straightforward method to pan a source around on an arbitrary number
  of speakers on a horizontal polygon or a 3D surface, even if the speaker
  layout is highly irregular.
</p>

<h2>Basic concepts</h2>
<p>
  VBAP was developed by Ville Pulkki at Aalto University, Helsinki, in 2001.
  It works by distributing the signal to the speakers nearest to the desired
  direction with appropriate weightings, aiming to create a maximally sharp 
  phantom source by using as few speakers as possible:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>one speaker, if the desired direction coincides with a speaker
  location,</li>
  <li>two speakers, if the desired direction is on the line between two
  speakers,</li>
  <li>and three speakers in the general 3D case.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Thus, if you move the panner onto a speaker, you can be sure that only
  this speaker will get any signal. This is handy when you need precise
  1:1 routing.<br />
  The drawback of VBAP is that a moving source will constantly change its 
  apparent sharpness, as it transitions between the three states mentioned 
  above.
</p>
<p>
  A horizontal VBAP panner has one parameter, the <strong>azimuth
  angle</strong>. A 3D panner offers an additional <strong>elevation
  angle</strong> control.
</p>
<div class="well">
  More elaborate implementations of VBAP also include a
  <strong>spread</strong> parameter, which  will distribute the signal over a 
  greater number of speakers in order to maintain constant (but no longer 
  maximal) sharpness, regardless of position. Ardour's VBAP panner does not 
  currently include this feature.
</div>

<h2>Speaker layout</h2>
<p>
  Each VBAP panner is specific to its <strong>speaker layout</strong>
  &mdash; the panner has
  to "know" about the precise location of all the speakers. A complete VBAP
  implementation must therefore include the possibility to define this
  layout.

<p>
  Ardour currently uses a simplified approach: if a track or bus has more
  than two output channels (which implies stereo), it assumes that you
  have N speakers distributed in a regular N-gon. That means that for
  irregular layouts such as 5.1 or 7.1, the direction you dial in will
  differ a bit from the actual auditory result, but you can still achieve
  any desired spatialisation.
</p>
<h3>Experimental 3D VBAP</h3>

<p>
  For tracks with 10 outputs, Ardour will currently assume a 3-dimensional
  speaker layout corresponding to Auro-3D 10.1, which is a horizontal 5.1
  system, four elevated speakers above L, R, Ls, and Rs, and an additional
  "voice-of-god" speaker at the zenith.
</p>

<h2>N:M panning</h2>

<p>
  For tracks and busses with more than one input, Ardour will (for now) assume that
  you wish to distribute the inputs symmetrically along the latitude around
  the panner direction. The width parameter controls the opening angle of
  the distribution sector.
