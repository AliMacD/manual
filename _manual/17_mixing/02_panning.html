title: Panning
---                        

<p>
<em>Panning</em> is the process of distributing 1 or more signals
    across a series of outputs so that the listener will have the
    experience of them coming from a particular "space" within the
    overall listening field.
</p>
<p>
  It is used to create a sense of space and/or a sense of motion in an
  audio mix. You can spread out different signals acros the space, and
  make them move within the space over time.
</p>

<h2>Types of Panners</h2>

<p>
  The way a panner works depends a great deal on how many signals it
  is going to process and how many outputs it will send them to. The
  simplest case is distributing a single signal to 2 outputs, which is
  the common case when using a "mono" track and a stereo speaker
  setup.
</p>
<p>
  But panning in Ardour could theoretically involve distributing any
  number of signals to any number of ouputs. In reality, Ardour does
  not have specific panners for each different situation. Currently,
  it has dedicated panners for the following situations:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 signal distributed to 2 outputs (the "mono" panner)</li>
    <li>2 signals distributed to 2 outputs (the "stereo" panner)</li>
    <li>N signals distributed to N outputs (the "vbap" panner)</li>
  </ul>
<p>  
  Even for each of these cases, there are many different ways to
  implement panning. Ardour currently offers just one solution to each
  of these situations, but in the future will offer more.
</p>

<h2>Panning is not Balance</h2>

<p>
  If you are used to the "balance" control found on most home music
  playback devices, and on many DAWs and audio editors, you may have
  gained a particular idea of how "panning" should work. You turn the
  knob to the left, and the signal in the right speaker gradually
  vanishes as you do. You turn it back to the right, and the signal in
  the left speaker vanishes in the same way.
</p>
<p>
  This is <strong>not</strong> panning. It does not alter the placement either the
  left or right signal, but rather is just a different term for
  "independent gain control". What is actually happening is that as
  you move the balance control left of center, it reduces the volume
  of the right channel towards zero, but leaves the left signal at
  normal volume. When you move it back to right of center, it reduces
  the volume of the left channel toward zero, and leaves the right
  channel at normal volume. When the control is exactly in the middle,
  both channels are at normal volume.
</p>
<p>
  The panners in Ardour control the distribution of at least one
  signal across at least 2 outputs. Ardour does not (currently) come
  with a balance control. Many people would like to see one.
