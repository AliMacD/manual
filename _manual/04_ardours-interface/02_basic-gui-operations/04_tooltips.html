  <p>By default, Ardour will often show helpful information about the purpose and use of most GUI control (buttons etc.) if you position the pointer over the GUI control and leave it there momentarily. These can be a good way to discover the purpose of many aspects of the GUI.</p>
<p>This can be distracting for experienced users, who may opt to disable it via <code>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; GUI &gt; Show tooltip if mouse hovers over a control</code>.</p>
