title: Deleting Objects
---                        


  
  <p>Within the Editor window (and to some extent within the Mixer window too), there are several techniques for deleting objects (regions, control points, and more).</p>
<h2>Using the mouse and keyboard</h2>
<p>Select the object(s) and then press the Delete key. This does <strong>not</strong> put the deleted object(s) into the cut buffer, so they cannot be pasted elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Using normal cut and paste</h2>
<p>Select the object(s) and then press <kbd class="mod1">x</kbd>. This puts the deleted object(s) into the cut buffer so that they can be pasted elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Using just the mouse</h2>
<p>By default, <kbd>Shift-right-click</kbd> will delete the clicked-upon object. Like the Delete key, this does <strong>not</strong> put the deleted object(s) into the cut buffer, so they cannot be pasted elsewhere.</p>
<p>The modifier and mouse button used for this can be controlled via <code>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; User Interaction &gt; Delete using ...</code>. Any modifier and mouse button combination can be used.</p>
