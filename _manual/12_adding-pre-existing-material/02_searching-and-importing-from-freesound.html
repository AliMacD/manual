<p><a href="http://www.freesound.org" title="http://www.freesound.org">http://www.freesound.org</a> is an online repository of searchable sound files. The “Search Freesound” of the Import dialog tab allows you to search the Freesound database, download &amp; audition files from within the Import dialog.</p>
<p>Tags: enter the “tags” that you would like to search. You may enter multiple search terms separated by spaces. For example “drums 120bpm” will search for files that are tagged “drums” OR “120bpm”.</p>
<p>Sort: Choosing one of the sort options will cause Freesound to order the files before returning the list of available files. This can save time if you know (for example) the sound you need is very short.</p>
<p>Search: Click this button to initiate the search. Freesound will begin returning pages of information, with 20 items per page. You may click “Stop” to stop downloading.</p>
<p>The file list: Click on a file to download it from Freesound. Double-click the file to auto-play it in the auditioner.</p>
<p>Files imported with Freesound will automatically include any Tags that are associated with the file, and these tages will be included in a search when you use the “Search Tags” tab.</p>
