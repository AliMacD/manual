title: Getting To Know the Locations+Marks List
---                        


  
  
<p>The Locations+Marks List is visible on a tab in the Editor Lists area. It can be used as a single point of control for all range and location markers (including the punch and loop ranges), or as a supplement to other methods of working with them.</p>
<p>First, there is the current loop and punch range; there are three clocks, being the start of the range, the end of the range and the length of the range. The start and end points have a ‘Use PH’ button beside them, which you can click to set the corresponding position using the current position of the playhead. Following this is a list of the session's markers, and finally there is a list of the range markers. At the bottom of the list are buttons to add new markers or ranges. The - button beside each marker and range allows that particular mark to be removed.</p>
