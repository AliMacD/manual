title: Controlling Playback
---                        


  
  
<p>Ardour offers many ways to control playback of your session, including the transport bar, key bindings and remote controls. You can also use markers to define locations or ranges within the session and rapidly move around between them. </p>
<p>Note that if you synchronize Ardour with other devices then some or all of these control methods may not be available - depending on the synchronization protocol, Ardour may respond only to commands sent from the other device(s).</p>
